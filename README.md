# MultiLayerPerceptron-NN
Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network on MNIST dataset

We are going to pretend as if we have a sophisticated NN (without CNN brain)

1. Hyperparameters
2. Network Parameters
3. TF Graph Input
4. MLP Model
5. Weights, Biases, Cost , Optimizer
6. Running and evaluating the accuracy
